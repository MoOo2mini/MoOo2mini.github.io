# Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using MathJax 3 engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like

$$
E = mc^2
$$

If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.

# Images and Figures

You can include images like this:

![](path/to/image.png)

**Figure 1:** Caption describing the image.
